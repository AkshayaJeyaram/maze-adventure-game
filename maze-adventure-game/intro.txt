You awaken in a dark, damp chamber.
A flickering torch on the wall casts eerie shadows around you.
You don't remember how you got here...
But you know one thing: you must escape.

As you step forward, a voice echoes through the air:
"Welcome, traveler... to the Maze of Mysteries."

There is no map.
There are no second chances.
Only your wits, your choices... and your lives.

May luck be on your side.
